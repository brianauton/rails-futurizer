Drag your legacy Rails apps into the future a little less painfully.

### Requirements

  * None, although it won't do anything unless it's installed
    alongside a version of Rails for which the gem contains some
    applicable fixes.

### Getting Started

Install the rails-futurizer gem alongside rspec in your gemfile.

    gem "rails-futurizer"

That's it! Any applicable fixes will be activated automatically, and
any that aren't applicable because of your current version of Rails,
Ruby, etc. will be ignored.

### Fixes Included

None yet.

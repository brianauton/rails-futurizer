Drag your legacy Rails apps into the future a little less painfully.

### Requirements

  * Ruby 1.8.7 or greater

  * RubyGems v1.1.0 or greater

  * Nothing else, although rails-futurizer won't do anything unless
    it's installed alongside a version of Rails for which some
    applicable fixes are available.

### Getting Started

Install the rails-futurizer gem alongside rspec in your gemfile.

    gem "rails-futurizer"

That's it! Any applicable fixes will be activated automatically, and
any that aren't applicable because of your current version of Rails,
Ruby, etc. will be ignored.

### Fixes Included

None yet.
